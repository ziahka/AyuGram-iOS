# Example (Cursor/VSCode)

This is a simple collection of iOS/watchOS/macOS apps that lets you see sourcekit-bazel-bsp in action. This example and instructions were designed specifically for **Cursor**, but should also work for VSCode.

## Initial Setup Instructions

- Make sure you fulfill the toolchain requirements for sourcekit-bazel-bsp, available at the main README.
- Install [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) if you haven't already: `brew install bazelisk`
  - Make sure you're using **Xcode 26** as this is what this project was developed with.
- Install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) if you haven't already: `brew install fzf`
  - This is used to power the simulator selection features.
- On this folder, run:
  - `bazelisk run //HelloWorld:setup_sourcekit_bsp_example_project`
- (Optional) Follow the instructions from the main README regarding configuring a custom SourceKit-LSP binary.
- Follow the instructions from the main README regarding either opening or reloading a workspace targeting this folder.
- Open a Swift file to load the extension. It has to be a Swift file; as of writing this will not work if you open a Objective-C file (but they will work fine after the extension is loaded).
- (If reloading the entire window) Wait for the Swift extension to launch. We've seen that this can take a couple of seconds depending on the version of your extension.

After performing these steps, you should already be able to see the basic indexing features in action. It may take a minute or two the first time, but you can see the progress at the bottom of the IDE. You should also be able to see a new `SourceKit Language Server` option on the `Output` tab that shows sourcekit-lsp's internal logs, and after modifying a file for the first time an additional `SourceKit-LSP: Indexing` tab will pop up containing more detailed logs from both tools.

## Building and Debugging

- To build the example iOS app: `Terminal` -> `Run Build Task...` -> `Build HelloWorld`
- To run a debug build, launch a simulator and attach `lldb`:
  - First, select an appropriate iOS simulator via `Terminal` -> `Run Task...` -> `Select Simulator for Apple Development`. The minimum OS version of the example app is **iOS 17.0**.
  - Then: Cmd+Shift+D -> `Debug HelloWorld (Example)`. After building, the IDE will automatically launch your selected simulator and attach it to the IDE's lldb extension.

## Considerations

See the main README for a description of what is and isn't supported at the moment. This project is under active development, so certain features might not yet be available.

## Troubleshooting

If something weird (or nothing) happens, check the `SourceKit-LSP: Indexing` logs for details of what may have happened. If you don't see that option at all, first run `Cmd+S` on a Swift file to see if that does the trick, and if it's still not there, try logging sourcekit-bazel-bsp directly by following the troubleshooting instructions in the main README.
