// os_log has a maximum message length, so longer messages need to be split into multiple logs.

import OSLog

/// Splits `message` on newline characters such that each chunk is at most `maxChunkSize` bytes long.
///
/// The intended use case for this is to split compiler arguments and a file's contents into multiple chunks so
/// that each chunk doesn't exceed the maximum message length of `os_log` and thus won't get truncated.
///
///  - Note: This will only split along newline boundary. If a single line is longer than `maxChunkSize`, it won't be
///    split. This is fine for compiler argument splitting since a single argument is rarely longer than 800 characters.
